    <li><b>Highest Level (Level 1)</b>: The highest level of preservation support. We will make our best effort
        to maintain all the content, structure and functionality of the work
        you deposit by taking appropriate preservation actions over time.</li>
    <li><b>Limited (Level 2)</b>: Limited preservation 
        support. We will preserve the content of the deposit, but its appearance 
        and functionality may not be preservable over time.</li>
    <li><b>As-is (Level 3):</b>We preserve your deposit "as-is". This is commonly called bit-level preservation,
        where the work is preserved exactly as you deposited it in Deep Blue.</li>
