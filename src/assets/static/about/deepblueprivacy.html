<h3>Your Privacy in Deep Blue</h3>


  <p>
Your privacy is important to us, and its protection is supported by
national and state laws, specifically the <a
href="http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-Act-455-of-1982"
target=link>Michigan Library Privacy Act</a> as well as by <a
href="http://www.itd.umich.edu/itpolicies/" target=link>UM policies and

<h4>
<em>What information gets collected and stored automatically?</em></h4>
 
  <p>
We gather information about use of Deep Blue so we can better meet your
needs and troubleshoot problems. This information, in the form of
session logs (which contain data such as browser type and IP address) is
retained for approximately 2 weeks, then discarded.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Does Deep Blue store personally-identifiable information?</em></h4>
	
  <p>
No. While we do collect some information that can identify you as an
individual user, we do not store it any longer than necessary for
troubleshooting. Additionally, the Library purges use data on items
viewed or downloaded from Deep Blue. Note, however, that information you
choose to save in the following areas is retained:</p>
	
  <ul>
    <li>Information you store in My Deep Blue;</li>
    <li>Information matching your name with the 
items you deposit, and;</li>
    <li>Questions and comments submitted to feedback 
and help, identifiable if you provide a reply email address.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
Access to the above information is restricted to Library staff who need
to use it in the normal course of Library business. This information is
never used for commercial or marketing purposes and will never be
revealed to any third party except by such process, order, or subpoena
authorized by national, state, or local law.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h4>
<em>How do you protect this information?</em></h4>
  <p>
To guard against unauthorized access, maintain the integrity of the
data, and promote the proper use of that data we have implemented
physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
the information we collect.</p>
  <p>
While we consider these reasonable measures, no guarantee can be made
that they will always prevent invalid access or improper activity. For
this reason, wherever possible we delete data (such as information about
what items you have previously viewed) that might cause activities to be
linked to you as an individual.</p>
