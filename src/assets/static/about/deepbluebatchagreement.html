  <p><b>UM Institutional Repository</b></p>
  <p><b>Blanket Agreement for Batch Deposits</b><br>
  <b>Author's Deposit Agreement</b><br>
  <b>Version 1.2, 30 January 2006</b><br>
  <p><b>This Agreement would be associated with 
    each deposit that is batch loaded by a designee (Community/Collection Coordinator), since 
    the batch load process bypasses the standard click-through license in the 
    submission workflow. It assumes that the designee, not the author, will do 
    batch loads.</b></p>
  <p>This Agreement is made by and between the [community name]____________ of 
    the University of Michigan (hereinafter called the Community), represented 
    by_____________, the Community's Collection Coordinator (hereinafter called the Designee) 
    and the University of Michigan Library's Deep Blue Institutional Repository 
    (hereinafter called the Repository) and is entered into on this ______day 
    of ________, 20__.</p>
  <p>This agreement allows the Designee to act 
    on behalf of individual depositors and/or the Community and authorizes the 
    Coordinator to batch load content to the Repository.</p>
  <p>On behalf of the Community, the Designee acknowledges having read all policies of the Repository and agrees to abide by the terms and conditions therein.
 For content entrusted or gifted to the Designee, the Designee agrees that making the content available in the Repository is an appropriate and acceptable extension of its agreement with the Community, and is consistent with the Designee's charge to provide access to this content.
 In addition, the Coordinator has conveyed to appropriate Community representatives the terms and conditions outlined in those policies, including the language of the standard deposit license quoted below and that the Community members have granted the Coordinator the authority to deposit content on their behalf.</p>
  <p>The standard deposit license states:</p>
  <p>I hereby grant to the Regents of the University 
    of Michigan the non-exclusive right to retain, reproduce and distribute the 
    deposited work (the Work) in whole or in part, in and from its electronic 
    format. This agreement does not represent a transfer of copyright to the University 
    of Michigan.</p>
  <p>The University of Michigan may make and keep 
    more than one copy of the Work for purposes of security, backup, preservation 
    and access, and may migrate the Work to any medium or format for the purpose 
    of preservation and access in the future. The University of Michigan will 
    not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this agreement, to the Work.</p>
  <p>I represent and warrant to the University 
    of Michigan that the Work is my original work. I also represent that the Work 
    does not, to the best of my knowledge, infringe or violate any rights of others.</p>
  <p>I further represent and warrant that I have 
    obtained all necessary rights to permit the University of Michigan to reproduce 
    and distribute the Work and that any third-party owned content is clearly 
    identified and acknowledged within the Work.</p>
  <p>By granting this license, I acknowledge that 
    I have read and agreed to the terms of this agreement and all related University 
    of Michigan and Deep Blue policies.</p>
  <p>This document will be stored in the Repository 
    attached to each deposit submitted by the Community.</p>
