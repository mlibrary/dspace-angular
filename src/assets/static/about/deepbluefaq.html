<a name="top"><b>Getting Started with Deep Blue: Frequently Asked Questions</b></a></p> 

  <p>
Deep Blue is the University of Michigan's permanent, safe, and
accessible service for representing our rich intellectual community
online. The primary goal of Deep Blue is to provide access to the work
that makes Michigan a leader in research, teaching, and creativity. By
representing our scholars, from faculty through students, as individuals
and as members of groups, Deep Blue provides a framework for preserving
and finding the best scholarly and artistic work done at the University.</p>

  <p>
What follows describes the types of works and collections the UM Library
envisions for Deep Blue, and how we gather, preserve, and offer access
to them. Because Deep Blue is designed to meet not only today's needs,
but also new needs as they evolve, this document is a work in progress.
Some aspects will undergo revision to reflect current needs and norms
identified by UM faculty, staff, students, and the collections they
create.</p>

  <h3>
<a name="ccc">Content and Collections</a></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <h4><em>
What types of content can be deposited in Deep Blue?</em></h4>

  <p>
We encourage the deposit of works with the following characteristics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The work must be produced or sponsored by UM faculty, staff, students,
or UM academic and administrative research units with which our scholars are affiliated.</li>
    <li>The work must be educational, artistic, or research-oriented.</li>
    <li>The work must be a completed version, ready for distribution.</li>
    <li> The author/owner must be willing and able to grant UM the non-exclusive right to preserve and distribute the work via Deep Blue. (See <a href="#whatrights" class="text"><em>&quot;What rights  do I grant the University when I deposit my work in Deep Blue?&quot;</em></a>).</li>
    <li>If the work is part of a series, we strongly encourage you to deposit 
other works in that series so that Deep Blue can offer as complete a set as possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Examples of these works include:</p>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Articles, preprints, working papers, technical reports, conference papers, web-based exhibits/presentations, etc.</li>
    <li>Books</li>
    <li>Theses</li>
    <li>Data sets (scientific, demographic, GPS, etc.)</li>
    <li>Computer programs</li>
    <li>Visualizations, simulations, and other models</li>
    <li>Multimedia</li>
    <li>Learning objects (typically modular resources used in teaching, e.g. texts, syllabi, websites)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
The Library has begun to populate Deep Blue with new and existing
digital works identified as having current and lasting value to the
campus. We will continue to do that, but our goal for Deep Blue is to
have decisions on what it should contain and offer be made mainly by you
and the other members of the UM community at large. So, we encourage you
to deposit your work and to contact us if you have format conversion
needs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em><a name="whocandeposit">Who can deposit items in Deep Blue?</a></em></h4>

  <p>
<strong>Individuals can deposit items</strong> -- defined as individual
files/documents or related groups of files -- into collections and
collection administrators can create groups that can create new
collections and deposit items into collections. Example: A faculty
member giving a presentation at a conference can deposit the slides for
that presentation, the data behind the corresponding research, audio
and/or video clips supporting the research, a working paper about the
research, and so on, all as one package to be identified with a single
persistent URL to ensure reliable access.</p>

  <p>
We encourage the inclusion of excellent student work as well, though it
must be deposited through a UM faculty or staff member associated with
that work. This may happen directly (e.g., for Honors theses) or
indirectly in the case of officially recognized UM groups or
organizations with associated faculty sponsors (e.g., the UM Solar Car
Team). Ph.D. and Masters theses are a special case. Ph.D. theses are
handled through Rackham, and Masters theses are
handled by individual departments granting the degree. (Note that 
depositing student work will require additional permissions from the 
student in accordance with <a
href="http://www.ogc.umich.edu/faq_student.html" target=link>FERPA
regulations</a>.)</p>

  <p>
To get started, contact the administrator of the collection you'd like
to add your work to, or <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h4>
<em>What are Deep Blue collections?</em></h4>

  <p>
Deep Blue organizes its content around <strong>collections</strong> to
simplify the process of depositing your work and to provide you with the
most flexibility for finding work interesting to you. Schools, colleges,
departments, research institutes, and other <strong>large groups can
create collections</strong> in Deep Blue to group related works at the
broadest levels.</p>

  <p>
Collections allow people to explore a specific area in depth, or to
focus specifically on only the areas they find interesting. So,
<strong>collections contain the work of more focused/smaller groups and
individuals</strong>.</p>

  <p>
In the long term we hope to provide topical access that groups related
content together irrespective of who deposits it. With this structure in
place, you will be able to search or browse by collection, topic,
broader discipline, or type of work (e.g. theses and dissertations). As
we begin to offer searching across many universities and associate our
content with other Deep Blue equivalents at peer institutions, scholars
worldwide will have a rich and discipline-specific resource.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h4>
<em>Who can create new collections?</em></h4>
  
  <p>
<strong>Individuals can create collections</strong> for depositing their
own work, and collection administrators can create groups that can build
collections together. For example, a faculty member can place
presentation material in her own collection. She can also administer and
create other collections that gather together the work of her research
group so all their presentations, datasets, etc. are browsable and
searchable as a subset of the University's works. Colleagues from other
universities are likely to find these groupings helpful for finding the
work that's most interesting to them. To get started, contact the
administrator of the collection to which you'd like to add your work to,
or <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h4>
<em>Who can become an administrator?</em></h4>

  <p>
Each collection will have one or more administrator who will help the
Library define specific procedures that best suit its needs. This
administrator can be a faculty or staff member from a
school/college/etc., or can be a Library liaison to that school/college.
We are happy to help you set up collections and work with you to set up
access, membership, and other parameters. The collection structure is
intended to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individuals and
their colleagues, and the Library commits to making Deep Blue responsive
to the changing needs and nature of the creative, intellectual, and
artistic work done here. Please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> to get started.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<a name="ipr">Intellectual Property Rights</a></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>
Honoring your rights as a creator is a fundamental aspect of Deep Blue's
support of your work and the University's mission of creating knowledge.
The service's deposit agreements, policies, and principles ensure that
you retain all your intellectual property rights when depositing your
work.</p>

  <p>
Deep Blue also supports the University's mission of communicating the
knowledge created here to the citizens of Michigan and the world, and
does so by offering a service geared towards providing the broadest
possible access to our creative, intellectual, and artistic work. We
encourage you to explore all means of allowing others to build upon your
work. For example, we offer use of the <a
href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target=link>"Creative Commons"
license</a> as a supported option for your collection.</p>

  <p>
Because the topic of intellectual property has specific legal
implications, Deep Blue has a formal policy. It has four parts:</p>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>a <b><a href="deepblueip.html">Deep Blue Intellectual Property
Policy</a></b> that formally addresses the concepts outlined
below;</li>
    <li>an<b> Author's Deposit Agreement</b> (see below) used by an
author/creator depositing his or her own work;</li>
    <li>a<b> Collection Coordinator Agreement,</b> used by a designated
coordinator (such as a departmental administrator or secretary, or a
library liaison), and; </li>
    <li>a <b>Blanket Agreement for Batch Deposits</b> used when an
author/creator or designated coordinator deposits batches/groups of
work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em><a name="whatrights">What rights do I grant the University when I
deposit my work in Deep Blue?</a></em></h4>

  <p>
When you agree to our standard "Author's Deposit Agreement" (see below)
at the time of deposit you grant Deep Blue the <b>non-exclusive</b><span
style='font-weight:normal'> right to:</span></p>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>retain, reproduce, and distribute the deposited work;</li>
    <li>keep more than one copy of your work for purposes of security, backup, 
preservation, and access, and;</li>
    <li>migrate your work to any future medium or format for the purpose of
preservation and access.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
The <a href="deepblueauthorsdeposit.html">"Author's Deposit Agreement"</a>.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><em>The deposit agreement mentions "original work." What does that mean?</em></h4>

  <p>
In most cases it's obvious when a work is original to you, especially
when you are its sole creator. Other examples of original work that you
may deposit include:</p>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Annotated or illustrated versions of public domain works. For example,
if a UM mathematics lecturer added annotations to <em>Alice in
Wonderland</em> or an art professor illustrated <em>Moby Dick</em>, both
have created a new original work and we would encourage them to deposit
the digital versions of those works in Deep Blue.</li>
    <li>Works which you co-authored, such as reports on research done
with colleagues at UM or elsewhere. Unless you grant specific rights
(such as the right to distribute) to someone else, the intellectual
property is owned equally and in full by all creators.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Related to that, in the third and fourth paragraph of the agreement, you
represent that you have the right to make the deposit and that you're
not infringing on the rights of others by doing so. If you have
questions about the status of your work, a number of resources exist on
campus to assist you, including <a
href="http://www.copyright.umich.edu/" target=link>"Copyrights at the
University of Michigan"</a>. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><em>What rights do I retain?</em></h4>

  <p>
<strong>You retain all your intellectual property rights</strong>. The
limited rights you grant to Deep Blue are non-exclusive, and your
ability to grant, assign, or retain any and all rights you had before
your deposit does not change as a result of your deposit. Please note
that some publishers may ask that you grant them exclusive rights to
your work, thus limiting your ability to use it as you see fit and
perhaps even limiting your ability to deposit it in Deep Blue.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<a name="wcudb">Who Can Use Deep Blue</a></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Who can search, browse, and download from Deep Blue?</em></h4>

  <p>
Deep Blue is designed to provide your work the widest possible exposure,
so it is open to the world for searching. You may, however, choose to
deposit your work but prevent it from being seen in full for a limited
time. You may also choose to allow people to find out about the
existence of your work, but not download the work itself, again for a
limited time. See <a href="#canirestrict">"<em>Can I restrict access to
the item I deposited?</em>"</a> below for more details.</p>
  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>

  <h4>
<em>What conditions of use does Deep Blue grant people for my
deposit?</em></h4>

  <p>
<strong>As a depositor, you control the conditions of use for your
work</strong>. Depositing your work in Deep Blue does not affect your
copyright, so you retain all the rights you had before making it
available through this service. You are only granting UM the
non-exclusive right to distribute the work. See the section on <a
href="#ipr"><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></a> for more
information about rights, limitations of use, and suggestions for making
sure your work is accessible the way you want it to be.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>I just found some interesting work done by someone else in Deep
Blue and am about to download it -- what can I do with that work once I
have it?</em></h4>

  <p>
Directly above you'll see that <strong>depositors -- typically the
creators/authors -- control the rights to their work. </strong>Unless
otherwise noted in Deep Blue or on the work itself, you should treat the
work like any other copyrighted material, and may make <a
href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107"
target=link>"Fair Use"</a> of it as allowed by law.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<a name="canirestrict"><em>Can I restrict access to the item I
deposited? If so, to whom, and for how long?</em></a></h4>

  <p>
Yes. Since the work you deposit is complete and ready for distribution
(see <em>"What types of deposits do we encourage?"</em>), immediate and
worldwide access is the default (and preferred) status for all material
in Deep Blue. But we know situations exist where you won't want to offer
immediate access. So, legal requirements the University is bound to
honor (such as FOIA requests) notwithstanding, you can limit access to
items in Deep Blue collections for a period of time defined by the
community or collection into which you're depositing your work.</p>

  <p>
For example, you can limit access to an item to only people from your
research group or department for a period of time after you deposit it.
That way everyone from your team/department can find your work and use
it, while those outside cannot. This limitation can be extended to the
full metadata as well. This limited "embargo period," agreed on by the e
collection's administrator(s) and Deep Blue staff, will determine  when
the full description and the item itself will become accessible to the
UM community -- and later the world -- at large. Standard embargo
periods are:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Immediate access to full description and all files (the default)</li>
    <li>Access to full description and all files in 3 months</li>
    <li>Access to full description and all files in 6 months</li>
    <li>Access to full description and all files in 1 year </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
You can also limit access to an item to people on the UM campus. This
limitation does not extend to the descriptive metadata -- those outside
will be able to find out about the item when they search Deep Blue. Here
again, a limited embargo period can be applied to worldwide access to
the item itself.</p>

  <p>
Your collection administrator, together with the Deep Blue staff at the
Library, define the embargo options offered on your deposit form.
Contact your collection administrator if you have questions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<a name="dyw">Depositing Your Work</a></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<h4>
<em>What do I have to do to deposit work?</em></h4>

  <p>
For UM faculty and staff, the first step is to either identify a
collection to work with, or to create one. (The process is different if
you are a student. See <em><a href="#whocandeposit">"Who can deposit
items in Deep Blue?"</a></em> above for more information.) We encourage
you to browse Deep Blue and then <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Library
staff at Deep Blue</a> who will assist you in contacting the right
collection administrators to gain permission to deposit your work. We
can also help you create a collection if that's more appropriate.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>
<em>What descriptive information do I assign to the work at time of deposit?</em></h4>

  <p class="MsoHeader">
To provide searchability beyond simply the full text, depositors  must
provide:</p>

  <ul type=disc>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Creator/Owner (typically this is also the Author)</li>
    <li>Date of publication/creation/issue</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
We encourage you to provide more complete descriptive information --
also known as metadata -- by filling out as many fields on the deposit
form as possible. This will allow Deep Blue to offer more ways of
finding and retrieving the work based on your special knowledge of its
contents. If you would like to customize your collection's interface so
you can ensure more than Deep Blue's minimum metadata are required,
please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Will the Library enhance my deposit by, for example, adding
additional metadata?</em></h4>

  <p>
Deep Blue is intended to reflect the campus and its scholarly activity,
and to make the work done here accessible as promptly as possible. When
the Library finds that we can improve access by enhancing the
information about a deposited item we will do our best to make those
enhancements. If you wish to have us do this for items you deposit,
please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> and we will be glad to discuss how best to accomplish it and
whether any costs will be involved.</p>

  <p>
Works that include raw data (such as social science datasets, GIS files)
are noteworthy in that metadata for them needs to be far more detailed
than for other items since author, title or even a full-text search will
typically not help someone new to the material determine whether those
data are of interest. Please contact us at the time of deposit so we can
assist you in describing them more fully.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>When depositing items, can I insert superscripts, subscripts, and other special characters in titles, abstracts, etc.?</em></h4>

  <p>
Yes, although doing so is not as simple as cutting/pasting from a
typical word processor document. You need to do a little extra work, and
use a UTF-8 or -16 font; 'Arial' is a good choice for Roman characters,
and one that you can commonly find on a PC or Macintosh.</p>

  <p>
To insert special characters, in Microsoft Windows XP you use the
Character Map program (START/Programs/Utilities/Character Map). On a
Macintosh, you use the Character Palette (under the flag icon showing
your keyboard type in the upper right hand of the screen). Pick a UTF-8
or -16 font from the Map/Palette and you'll notice that in these fonts a
superscript 2 is a separate character from a 2 upon which you might
apply e.g. Microsoft Word's character formatting. So to enter a title
into Deep Blue, you would first copy and paste the title from your word
processing document into a new one. Then:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Identify every special character (superscripts, subscripts,
symbols, non-Roman characters, etc.) and find them in the Character
Map/Palette.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop the special character from the Map/Palette into the
appropriate place, and delete the version that you made via the word processor's 
formatting option.</li>
  <li>Repeat these two steps until you've recreated the whole title.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
Then, copy and paste this title into the appropriate field on your Deep
Blue form. Though this sounds complex, it's actually harder to describe
than it is to do. If you have any questions, please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 

<h4>
<em>Will the Library enhance my deposit in other ways?</em></h4>

  <p>
When the Library determines we can improve access by providing a new
context for the work (such as representing the work in additional
collections beyond the one you deposited it in) or better preserve your
work by changing its format, we will do so.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4>
<em>Does Deep Blue assign any metadata automatically?</em></h4>

  <p>
At the time of deposit Deep Blue automatically assigns</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Persistent URL for you and others to cite</li>
    <li>Deposit Date</li>
    <li>Depositor's Name</li>
    <li>File Format (based on its extension)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
This information is used to manage content over time.</p>

  <p>
If you would like to further customize your collection interface to add
more information automatically, please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a>.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><em>
If I don't want to assign a lot of descriptive metadata to my deposit,
will the Library do it for me?</em></h4>

 <p>
Yes. The Library will assign additional metadata whenever it can do so.
For example, we can help you add the Michigan Metadata in use by <a
href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/bluestream" target=link>BlueStream</a>
and other projects, or connect you with a cataloger who can help you
better describe your content.</p>

  <p>
Assigning metadata can be time-consuming and therefore costly, so if you
need help from the Library, please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> and we will work with you to reach an agreement on how to
accomplish this most effectively.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Can I deposit content in any format?</em></h4>

  <p>
Our goal of providing access to your work means that Deep Blue accepts
all digital formats. However, not all formats can receive the same level
of preservation support.</p>

  <p>
For more detailed information about format support, see the <b><a
href="#pres" class="text">Preservation and Accessibility</a></b>
section.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>
What types of deposits does the Library discourage?</em></h4>

  <p>
The guidelines above are inclusive, and purposely so, as we hope to have
Deep Blue represent the UM intellectual environment as broadly as
possible. Deciding what should be included in Deep Blue is largely the
function of the individual depositors and the collections with which
they're affiliated. Individuals and collection administrators may wish
to work closely with their Library liaisons and may decide it's more
efficient and convenient to delegate some of the deposit decisions to
them.</p>

  <p>
While there may be cases where the Library will need to discuss deposits
with you, or even remove a deposit, we anticipate these cases will be
rare. There are however some items that you may not be able to deposit 
or that may find a better home, either temporarily or permanently,
elsewhere at UM. Two examples of the latter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Works in progress will typically be better served via personal websites,
departmental servers, in Blue Stream or perhaps via CTools, all of which
provide tools and platforms for modifying and completing work to make it
ready for distribution.</li>
    <li>Per the Standard Practice Guide, some completed materials,
especially those of an administrative nature, are better suited for
the University Archives at the Bentley Historical Library.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Deep Blue may in exceptional cases decline a submission due to technical
challenges or out-of-scope content. If you have questions please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> and we will be glad to help you determine the best place for
your item(s).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4>
<em>What type of already existing materials can I add to Deep Blue?</span></em></h4>

  <p>
Deep Blue will focus on new digital materials, and the Library will also
experiment with making some of its large digital collections of UM-based
work available as well.</p>

  <p>
That said, we encourage collection administrators and individuals
(including Library selectors and departmental liaisons) to continue to
identify excellent but less current materials, both in digital and
non-digital form. UM has produced a tremendous amount of interesting
work, and that will require prioritization, especially when that work
must be digitized to make it available through Deep Blue. Please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> if you have items like this and we will work with you to make
them available.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>How large a deposit can I make?</em></h4>

  <p>
The size of an item does not matter as such. There are practical
limitations, though, especially where video, large datasets and similar
items are concerned. Because of network constraints, depositing files
larger than 250 Mb will probably require the assistance of the Library,
which can provide better means for reliably depositing them. (For
instance, we will want to compare checksums on your file before and
after deposit to verify that the file transferred correctly and
completely.) We will handle these on a case-by-case basis, so please
contact <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> if you plan to deposit large files.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Can I withdraw a deposit?</em></h4>

  <p>
Yes. Deep Blue is designed to provide long-term, permanent access to the
items you deposit. However, we know circumstances can arise where a
deposit will need to be removed from view. When this becomes necessary,
contact your collection administrator and together we will determine the
best course of action to take.</p>

  <p>
However, since any item in Deep Blue may have been cited via its
persistent URL, we will always supply a "tombstone" whenever the item is
requested. The tombstone will contain the metadata for the item, with
one of the following messages indicating why the item was removed:</p>

  <dl>
    <dd>"Removed from view by legal order."</dd>
    <dd>"Removed from view by the University of Michigan."</dd>
    <dd>"Removed from view at request of the author."</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
The tombstone metadata will be visible to those who already have its
persistent URL, but your deposit and its metadata will no longer be
searchable and we will make these items unavailable for harvesting by
services such as OAIster and Google.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Can I remove a file from an existing deposit?</em></h4>

  <p>
Though it is possible under certain circumstances, to preserve the historical record of your scholarship, and
because others may have cited the old version, the preferred way to
handle this is to clearly mark the old, out-of-date version as
"Superceded" in both the 'Description' field for the file and add a
coversheet (or its equivalent) to the file itself. Contact your
collection administrator for help with this.</p>

<h3><a name="pres">Preservation and Accessibility</a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>                                                                                                                                                 

  <p>
Deep Blue is committed to providing long-term access to every deposit
you make. At the same time, while the Library has a long history and
many years of experience in the area of preservation, we recognize that
both the digital landscape and our understanding of the complexities of
digital preservation continue to evolve. We anticipate that over time
both the public and private sectors will develop more tools and
techniques to facilitate long-term preservation of digital information,
so these preservation principles and policies will continue to
evolve.</p>

  <p>
For more specific information about our commitment to preservation, see
the <a href="deepbluepreservation.html">Deep Blue Preservation and Format
Support Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Can you explain the different levels of format support you provide
for my work?</em></h4>

  <p>
You may deposit work in any digital format in Deep Blue, but not all
formats can receive the same level of preservation commitment. Deep Blue
has designated three levels of support we can offer, based on criteria
such as the wide deployment of the format, availability of
publicly-documented specifications, and the expectation that tools will
be available to undertake controlled transformation or migration. They
are described in detail in the <a href="deepbluepreservation.html">Deep Blue Preservation and Format
Support Policy</a>.</p> 

  <p>
TIFF (.tiff, .tif) is an example of a "Level 1" type of format. Widely
used and an open standard, we can support it to our fullest extent. An
example of a "Level 2" format is an MS Word document (.doc). Because
Microsoft owns and controls the specifications for this format, but
doesn't publish them, some features like macros may not operate between
versions regardless of our best efforts. Windows Media Audio (.wma),
because of its close ties to a specific platform and because it is far
less common than MP3 or WAV formats, serves as a good example of a
"Level 3" format that we can only commit to preserving at the bit level.
In other words, in the future you will be able to download an exact copy
of the deposited file, but it may be difficult to open and use it
without legacy hardware and/or software. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>                                                                                                                                                 

<h4>
<em>What other preservation services does Deep Blue provide?</em></h4>

  <p>
For all content you deposit, Deep Blue will provide secure storage,
backup, management, fixity-checks, and periodic refreshment by copying
the data to new storage media. We will also undertake appropriate format
monitoring and provide adequate staffing and other resources to support
the services offered. In addition, Deep Blue staff is developing
best-practice guidelines to help depositors convert or create documents
that achieve the level of quality needed for information capture and the
highest degree of preservability over time.
Further, we make the following commitments to preservation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Deep Blue provides a persistent URL (we use "handles" that will
always point to either the deposited item or its metadata.</li>
    <li>The Library will maintain that persistent URL, and the
files/metadata associated with it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

<h4>
<em>What formats receive the Highest Level (Level 1) of
preservation?</em></h4>

  <p>
For a list of all recognized Deep Blue formats and their current support
levels, see the <a href="deepbluepreservation.html">Deep Blue
Preservation and Format Support Policy</a>. We expect to add to and
revise the support levels as standards emerge for digital preservation
of additional formats.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Why isn't PDF considered a Level 1 format? What is PDF/A?</em></h4>

  <p>
Adobe's Portable  Document Format (PDF), as you currently generate it
using most commercial applications on your computer, is a proprietary
format owned and controlled by Adobe Systems, Inc. So despite its wide
use, it is not publicly documented at this time. An international
preservation standard for PDF/A -- "ISO 19005-1 for PDF/A-1," where the
"A" stands for archive -- exists. We have developed <a
href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/58005" target=link>guidelines for
creating PDFs</a> to which we can apply our highest level (Level 1) of
preservation support. Please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact Deep Blue</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<em>Can you preserve all the relationships in items made up of multiple files?</em></h4>

  <p>
At present, the three levels of preservation commitment are made at the
individual file level. We will need to evaluate complex content -- items
comprised of files in various formats that interact with each other --
to determine whether the operational relationships between the files can
be maintained. Executables and some files that rely on a specific
hardware/software environment will also require additional evaluation
because not only the format but the access environment must be
considered in determining preservation issues. Please <a href="" onmouseover="this.href='m'+'a'+'i'+'l'+'t'+'o'+':'+'d'+'e'+'e'+'p'+'b'+'l'+'u'+'e'+'@'+'u'+'m'+'i'+'c'+'h'+'.'+'e'+'d'+'u'">contact the Deep Blue Preservation Group</a> if you wish to deposit  any of these content
types.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p> 

<h4>
<em>How accessible are Deep Blue documents for people with disabilities?</em></h4>

  <p>
Deep Blue accepts many formats and places few restrictions on depositors. 
As such, the files found here may vary in their accessibility features and 
their usability for people with disabilities. We encourage all depositors 
to make their work as accessible as possible, since this ensures ease of use
 and the broadest possible readership for their work. </p>
 
 <p>
 If you are unable to use a specific file in its current format, please select 
 the <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/feedback" target=link> Contact Us</a> 
 link and we can modify it to make it more accessible to you.
 </p>

  <p>
Since many of the items in Deep Blue are in PDF format, we have created
<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/58005" target=link> guidelines for creating high quality,
accessible PDFs</a>.</p>

  <p>
There are many applications that offer more robust capabilities that support 
a variety of file formats. On the U-M Ann Arbor campus, you can get assistance 
installing and using them via the
