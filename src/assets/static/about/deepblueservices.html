<h3>Deep Blue Services</h3>

<p>As outlined below, the University
of Michigan (UM) Library offers deposit, access, and preservation services to
support Deep Blue and its users. Additionally, the Library provides community
management, end-user support, and system management services to provide ongoing
support for Deep Blue communities, respond to user inquiries, and supply system
monitoring, back-up, and recovery. We are investigating services beyond those
in the Deep Blue Basic Service which may be offered through a &quot;Premium Service&quot;
model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Deposit Services</em></h4>

<p>Deep Blue offers contributors a flexible, easy-to-use
deposit process. A contributor completes a brief deposit form and grants
non-exclusive permission to distribute and preserve the work.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Register with Deep Blue and edit his/her user profile</li>
 <li>Add a deposit to a specified collection</li>
 <li>Enter descriptive information (metadata) for a deposit</li>
 <li>Include additional metadata with a deposit</li>
 <li>Bundle multiple files of various formats in a single deposit</li>
 <li>Identify formats of deposited files</li>
 <li>Grant a non-exclusive license to UM to distribute a deposit in accordance with
     the specified distribution policy and translate it for the purposes of
     preservation</li>
 <li>Receive updates on the progress of an item through the deposit workflow process</li>
 <li>View past and pending deposits in a personalized &quot;My Deep Blue&quot; page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Communities may decide to subject
new deposits to a review and approval process, customized to a community's
needs. The community administrator(s) establish workflows of the deposit
process and create the reviewer, coordinator and metadata editor roles during
  a community's or collection's initial set-up. This process may include the
following roles and steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewer: can review all content submitted to a collection and decide to accept or
      reject a deposit</li>
  <li>Coordinator: can edit metadata for all deposit and decide to accept or reject a deposit</li>
  <li>Editor: can only edit the metadata for a deposit</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the deposit workflow process, reviewers, coordinators,
and metadata editors can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Augment and approve deposits and deposit metadata in the workflow process</li>
  <li>Review the content of a deposit for appropriateness to the collection and make
     the decision to route a deposit back to the person who submitted it or to
     give approval</li>
  <li>Check the deposit's metadata for completeness and obvious errors, edit errors,
     and make the decision to route a deposit back to the depositor or give
     approval</li>
 <li>View, select, and perform workflow tasks from the &quot;Pending Workflow Tasks&quot;
     section of his/her personalized &quot;My Deep Blue&quot; page</li>
</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h4><em>Access Services</em></h4>
<p>Deep Blue's Access Services give
users the ability to browse, search, and discover items of interest, request
one or more items from the system, and take delivery of the requested items.
Those interested in accessing the contents of Deep Blue can:</span></p>

<ul>
 <li>Browse Deep Blue contents by title, author, or community/collection</li>
 <li>Search for items anywhere in Deep Blue, or within a particular community or
     collection.</li>
 <li>Search for matches within author, title, or full text words and view results</li>
 <li>View an item overview, including: Deep Blue core metadata, list of collections
     that contain this item, and links to each of the files (text, image, etc.)
     that comprise the item</li>
 <li>View the contents of an item online</li>
 <li>Download an individual item and view it within a web browser or save the file to a
     specified location.</li>
</ul>


<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><em>Repository Services and Quotas</em></h4>

<p>Deep Blue provides storage and
preservation services to ensure the longevity of deposited materials. Users
should be assured that content deposited in many formats (see <a href="deepbluepreservation.html">Preservation
Policy</a>) will be accessible even when the original
application in which it was created is obsolete and the means to access it are
inoperable. For each deposit, Deep Blue:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Provides persistent storage, including appropriate back-up and recovery procedures</li>
 <li>Assigns a unique persistent identifier (URI) that will not change and is
     appropriate to cite in other works</li>
 <li>Supports a range of service levels for preservation and notifies users of Deep
     Blue's preservation constraints</li>
 <li>Stores provenance information.</li>
 <li>Maintains an auditable history and record of changes to Deep Blue</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial storage quotas will be
based on the size of the Deep Blue community as determined by the Library.
Thereafter, the quotas will be reviewed on an annual basis at which time the
Library reserve the right to alter the quotas as dictated by demand and
resource availability. Communities with greater storage needs can contact Deep
Blue's administrators for further assistance.</span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><em>Community Management Services</em></h4>
<p>Deep Blue's Community Management
Services are a set of consultative and applied services designed to meet the
needs of individual communities. Library staff will provide guidance in
developing a community or collection's workflow process, metadata requirements,
and distribution policies as well as launching a Deep Blue community homepage.</p>


<p>The Library will manage all
aspects of the community set-up process, including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Planning
     and scheduling new community and collection set-ups</li>
 <li>At the request of a community, facilitating an initial community discussion
     and explaining set-up requirements</li>
 <li>Assisting in training community users and coordinators</li>
 <li>Implementing custom workflow for the deposit process including metadata defaults</li>
 <li>Assisting in customizing Deep Blue community and collection home pages</li>
 <li>Assisting with ongoing collection set-ups</li>
 <li>Specifying a collection's distribution policy and license requirements</li>
 <li>Coordinating bulk loads of historic content and metadata. </li>
</ul>

<p>A local coordinator&#8212;typically
a Library liaison or subject specialist&#8212;will help provide Community
Management Services with back-up from the Deep Blue Coordinator and the Systems
Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>End-User Support Services</em></h4>

<p>The Library will provide both
web-based and telephone support to all Deep Blue users. Support will be provided Monday through Friday, 9:00am to 5:00pm. Inquiries
will typically receive a return response via e-mail or telephone within one
business day.</p>


<p>The Deep Blue web site will provide documentation,
including <a href="deepbluefaq.jsp">FAQs</a> to
answer routine questions and user support contact information for more complex
questions.</p>


<p>Library liaisons and subject
specialists will work with the Deep Blue coordinator and Systems Administrator
to provide End-User Support Services, with back-up from the Digital Library
Production Services and its Core Services staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>System Management Services</em></h4>


<p>System Management Services are the
back-office support for Deep Blue, working to ensure optimal system performance
and high availability.</p>


<p>The UM Library will provide a
comprehensive set of technical services for Deep Blue system operations,
including:</p>


<ul>
 <li>Performing system monitoring, testing and debugging</li>
 <li>Performing system administration</li>
 <li>Monitoring and upgrading Deep Blue utility programs and middleware</li>
 <li>Developing approved system enhancements</li>
 <li>Performing bulk loading of historic content and metadata</li>
 <li>Maintaining a registry of known content and metadata formats for preservation
     purposes. </li>
</ul>


<p>The Deep Blue Systems Administrator will provide System
Management Services with back-up from the Digital Library Production Services
and its Core Services staff. The UM Library will provide 24/7 support for Deep
Blue's server, storage and network operations.</p>



<h4><em>Premium Services</em></h4>


<p>The Library is investigating the
introduction of a set of Premium Services to meet the exceptional resource
requirements of Deep Blue communities. Deep Blue was designed as a distributed
system that allows communities to manage their own collections, and the areas listed
above include all necessary functionality to achieve that. As with any new
service, though, it is difficult to determine how users will employ specific
features of the system and the resulting services they will demand. The Library
anticipates that some Deep Blue communities may want to outsource certain
activities to the Library or may put demands on the system that require
additional resources for support.</span></p>
