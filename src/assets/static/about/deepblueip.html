  <p><h4>UM Institutional Repository<br>
  Intellectual Property Policy<br>
  Version 1.0, 22 March 2005</h4></p>

  <p>Deep Blue, the University of Michigan Institutional Repository (referred 
    to hereafter as the Repository), is a service of the University of Michigan 
    Library, provided to lower access barriers and offer the widest possible dissemination 
    for the intellectual and creative output of the University. The Repository 
    also provides appropriate long-term preservation services for that content 
    to ensure continuing access over time. Content is made available through a 
    non-exclusive license granted by the author; there is no transfer of intellectual 
    property rights accompanying submission of content to the Repository.</p>
<dl>
   <dd><a href="deepblueauthorsdeposit.html">Author's Deposit Agreement</a></dd>
   <dd><a href="deepbluedesigneeforauthor.html">Agreement for Designee Submitting on Behalf of Author</a></dd>
  <dd><a href="deepbluebatchagreement.html">Blanket Agreement for Batch Deposits</a></dd>
</dl>  
  <p>The authors or 
    their designees grant to the Repository a non-exclusive right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>display and distribute the submission including its abstract and descriptive 
      information in electronic format in accordance with the Repository's policies</li>
    <li>copy, convert or migrate the submission 
      to any medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access</li>
    <li>keep more than one copy of the submission 
      for purposes of security, back-up, and preservation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When depositing a Work, depositors or their designees should represent the 
    Work's copyright status in a manner consistent with the University's copyright 
    policy, <a href="http://www.copyright.umich.edu/university-michigan-copyright-policies" target=link>Ownership Of Copyrighted Works Created At Or In Affiliation With 
    The University Of Michigan</a> (June 6, 2002, approved by the Regents on November 
    14, 2002). The Repository is committed to open access and prefers that content 
    be deposited without access restriction. However, it will make reasonable 
    efforts to limit access to authorized Michigan users or specific users, if 
    restrictions are associated with a submission at the time of deposit.</p>
	
  <p>The Repository will work with the depositor or their designee to allow submissions 
    to be added to, replaced or removed, to comply with subsequent changes to 
    an item's access policy or to reflect a revision to the work. In the event 
    a published submission is replaced or removed, the Repository will retain 
    a descriptive record for citation purposes.</p>
	
  <p>Although the 
    depositor or their designee has the right to remove content from the Repository, 
    we recommend that material be deposited in perpetuity, to ensure continuity 
    of access and citation and to facilitate long-term preservation.</p>
  <p>In addition, 
    the depositor or their designee grants to the Repository the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>share the descriptive information and 
      abstract for the submission in a variety of settings to encourage access</li>
    <li>enhance descriptive information about 
      the submission to support access</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Repository 
    shall obtain express written permission from the author or their designee 
    to use the content for any commercial purpose.</p>
  <p>In the event 
    of the dissolution of a research group, center, institute, or any other unit 
    that is represented in the Repository, content will continue to be held by 
    the Repository unless individual copyright holders request removal or access 
    restriction.</p>
  <p>In the case of 
    joint authorship, if the individual copyright holders disagree on whether 
    or how their Work is represented in the Repository, content will continue 
    to be held by the Repository in the manner in which it existed at the time 
    of the disagreement until the copyright holders jointly request a change to 
    that status.</p>
  <p>Content deemed 
    to be official University records may be transferred to the control of the 
    University Archives while remaining in the Repository.</p>
