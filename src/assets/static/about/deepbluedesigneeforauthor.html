  <b>UM Institutional Repository</b><br>
  <b>Click-Through Agreement: Designee Submitting on Behalf of Author</b><br>
  <b>Version 1.1, 31 January 2006</b><br>
  <p><b>This Agreement would be substituted for 
    the standard click-through license in a customized submission workflow where 
    we know that the Designee will be submitting content on behalf of Community 
    members.</b></p>
  <p>As the designated coordinator for this Deep 
    Blue Collection, I am authorized by the Community members to serve as their 
    representative in all dealings with the Repository. As the designee, I ensure 
    that I have read the Deep Blue policies. Furthermore, I have conveyed to the 
    community the terms and conditions outlined in those policies, including the 
    language of the standard deposit license quoted below and that the community 
    members have granted me the authority to deposit content on their behalf.</p>
  <p>The standard deposit licenses states:</p>
  <p><em>I hereby grant to the Regents of the University 
    of Michigan the non-exclusive right to retain, reproduce and distribute the 
    deposited work (the Work) in whole or in part, in and from its electronic 
    format. This agreement does not represent a transfer of copyright to the University 
    of Michigan.</em></p>
  <p><em>The University of Michigan may make and 
    keep more than one copy of the Work for purposes of security, backup, preservation 
    and access, and may migrate the Work to any medium or format for the purpose 
    of preservation and access in the future. The University of Michigan will 
    not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this agreement, to the Work.</em></p>
  <p><em>I represent and warrant to the University 
    of Michigan that the Work is my original work. I also represent that the Work 
    does not, to the best of my knowledge, infringe or violate any rights of others.</em></p>
  <p><em>I further represent and warrant that I 
    have obtained all necessary rights to permit the University of Michigan to 
    reproduce and distribute the Work and that any third-party owned content is 
    clearly identified and acknowledged within the Work.</em></p>
  <p>By 
    granting this license, I acknowledge that I have read and agreed to the terms 
    of this agreement and all related University of Michigan and Deep Blue policies.</p>
